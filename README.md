# City Bike App

## Description

The City Bike App is a web application that provides information about Helsinki city bikes, including data about bike stations and journeys. The project is built using React and Express, with TypeScript for both the front-end and back-end. The back-end utilizes a PostgreSQL database for storing data, and Redis for caching responses. 

The application allows users to view bike station information, such as availability of bikes and parking spaces, as well as details about previous bike journeys. It provides a user-friendly interface for searching and filtering bike stations, and offers features for planning bike routes and tracking bike usage.
